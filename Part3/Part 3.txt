Part 3: Reflection on the automation exercise

● In terms of the different testing categories that describe the scope of the test, how would you describe the type of test you have just written?

The type of test I did in part 2 was:
- End-to-end testing because I basically replicate a real user scenario.
- White box testing as I have access to the internal structure of the page (html code)
- And functional testing as I validate the functionality of searching for an item and adding it into the cart

● Outline the possibilities of automating these specific test cases in different scopes, together with a short summary of the pros and cons of each of them.
These test cases could be implemented in several other testing categories such as:
- Black box testing for manual test
Pro: Easy to execute and maintain
Con: Time consuming

Regression testing when a bug has been fixed
Pro: Allow to check if the bug has been fixed correctly and did not break anything else
Con: Would only be suitable only if the bug is part of the flow included in the steps

Sanity testing for a quick checkup
Pro: The test needs only 30s to run, so it's a quick way to figure out if the website is still working as expected
Con: Maybe needs to be ran a couple of times, just to make sure the test has not failed due to a connection time out

We could also use it as a smoke test, but it's perhaps a bit too long as they are usually done to verify functionalities like whether an application starts successfully.
